# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-Digital-Image-Processing-and-MATLAB

Medical Image Processing is one of the most challenging and emerging fields nowadays. The Detection, Segmentation, and Extraction from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images of contaminated tumor areas are significant concerns. Detection of human brain abnormal structures by basic imaging techniques is challenging.

This repository contains the source code in MATLAB. I have created GUI using GUIDE-MATLAB. Brain MRI images are provided as input and it detects whether a tumor is present or not. If yes, then highlights the brain tumor in the provided MRI image and gives it as output. Digital Image Processing algorithms such as Anisotropic Diffusion, Segmentation, and Morphological Operations have been implemented.
